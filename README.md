This is a software that allows you to tweak Hoplite Client to your liking and re-enable some features that are completely disabled such as Freelook, AutoTextHotkey, removing pinned servers, changing FPS text etc… However, those mods are disabled by the server for a reason. Therefore, use those features of Hoplite Tweaks at your own risk.

Features:

    Metadata – Enables freelook, removes blog posts, removes pinned servers, etc: it just removes Hoplite bloat in general.
    Modpacket Removal – Prevents servers from disabling mods on Hoplite Client
    Nickhider – Allows you to change your own IGN (only for yourself, can use colors)
    Custom commands – Allows you to set aliases / create custom commands (e.g. /qb might queue battleroyale with the /play) command. Very similar to AutoText Hotkey, except for the “hotkey” is a command.
    Uncap reach display – Allows the user to fix the reach display when in creative mode
    RPC – Show your activity, and show “Hoplite Tweaks” in your Discord Rich Presence
