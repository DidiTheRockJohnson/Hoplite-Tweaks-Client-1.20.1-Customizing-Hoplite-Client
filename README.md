This is a software that allows you to tweak Hoplite Client to your liking and re-enable some features that are completely disabled such as Freelook, AutoTextHotkey, removing pinned servers, changing FPS text etc… However, those mods are disabled by the server for a reason. Therefore, use those features of Hoplite Tweaks at your own risk.

# Features:

    Metadata – Enables freelook, removes blog posts, removes pinned servers, etc: it just removes Hoplite bloat in general.
    Modpacket Removal – Prevents servers from disabling mods on Hoplite Client
    Nickhider – Allows you to change your own IGN (only for yourself, can use colors)
    Custom commands – Allows you to set aliases / create custom commands (e.g. /qb might queue battleroyale with the /play) command. Very similar to AutoText Hotkey, except for the “hotkey” is a command.
    Uncap reach display – Allows the user to fix the reach display when in creative mode
    RPC – Show your activity, and show “Hoplite Tweaks” in your Discord Rich Presence

    Remove Fake Levelhead – Removes the “feature” that hoplite has to assign nicked players random levels in their Levelbar
    Fix Ping Sound – Fixes the chat mod “Play sound on mention” system to only respond to actual chat messages, not action bars
    NoHitDelay – Enables legacy combat, that makes sure the client doesn’t prevent swing/attack packets being sent for no reason
    Window Title – Allows you to change the name of the window
    Tasklist Privacy – Prevents Hoplite Client from sending all your processes to Hoplite Servers
    Hostlist Privacy – Prevents Hoplite Client from sending all your hosts file to Hoplite Servers
    Levelhead – Change levelhead prefix
    Toggle Sprint Text – Changes the text that toggle sprint says (maybe make a deez nuts joke idk)
    FPS spoof – Multiply your FPS counter with an arbitrary value
    FPS – change FPS text
    CPS – same thing
    AutoGG – same thing but with autogg text
    Keystrokes CPS – same thing
    Reach text – same thing
    Remove hashing – Might speed up the loading of Hoplite on low-end computers
    Debug Packets – Used by developers, helps to debug packets being sent and received from/to the Hopelite BukkitAPI
    Hoplite Options – Removes the Open to LAN button entirely (who uses it anyway) and replaces it with the Hoplite Tweaks Options button
    Toggle Sneak Container – Allows you to use togglesneak while in containers
    Ping Text & Ping Spoof – Allows you to change the text of the ping mod (might be removed in favour of the custom mods)
    ClothCosmetics – Enable ALL cosmetics for everyone ( client sided )
    HurtCamShake – Allows you to modify your hurt cam shake effect multiplier
    ChatLimit – Removes the maximum chat limit count to a preset value
    MumbleFix – Can allow mumblelink on linux, but requires the user to have a special native (not recommended to use)
    Enable Wrapped – Allows you to re-enable Hoplite client Wrapped, which can be useful for the people that still want to view it
    Remove Chat Delay – Removes the client-side websocket chat delay
    Allow Cosmetic Cominations – Allows a user to use multiple incompatible cosmetics at once
    Remove Splash Blur – Removes the blur on the Hoplite Tweaks background panorama
    RuntimeData – Internal module for looking for lunar client classes and methods
    HandleNotifications – Allows usage of LCNotificationPacket
    ModName – Changes the client brand to Hoplite Tweaks (version)/Hoplite Client (version)
